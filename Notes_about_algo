# Notes

## recursion loop

- For recursion, it's helpful to picture the call stack structure in your mind.
- If a recursion sits inside a loop, the structure resembles (almost) a N-ary tree.
- The loop controls horizontally how many branches at generated while the recursion decides the height of the tree.
- The tree is generated along one specific branch until it reaches the leaf (base condition) then expand horizontally to obtain other leaves and return the previous height and repeat.
